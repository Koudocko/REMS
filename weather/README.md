# Overview of Weather Station 

## Directory Structure
The Residence directory is composed by two sub directories, **pimoroni** and **webserver**

### Pimoroni
Pimoroni consists of a single python file which interfaces the RPi GPIO and transfers the data to the webserver, plus includes a Dockerfile for build. 

### Webserver
The webserver contains a complete Django project, bundled in with static CSS/JS files and the HTML template. A Dockerfile is also included to containerize it.
